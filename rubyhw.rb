puts "Tonight is the night when all of the #{adjective_one} monsters come out to #{verb_one}. #{adjective_two} witches with facial hairs as tough as boar bristles and boots full of #{noun_one} fly through the night sky snatching all the tech nerds in sight. Their bushy brows, jagged teeth and bloodless lips didn't stop all the programmers from being seduced. They quickly put #{number_one} spells on the Ruby boys while cutting their fingers off to stir into a #{color_one} stew. Those #{adjective_three} witches decided to doggie bag that stew until Nov 8th, where they intend to gift it for all those decided Trump voters. Each Trump supporter gets #{number_two+number_one} helpings each."
